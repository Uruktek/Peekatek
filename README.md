# Peekatek
Peek-a-Tek! Application to find where to catch Pokemon!


The basic idea of this application is to better my understanding of using JSON files along with C# programing.

The end goal will be:
1. Working Desktop (Windows) version.

2. Port to .NETCORE when WPF is available (Linux/Mac OS port)

3. Port to mobile of some kind. (Android vs iOS) Hopefully Xamrin works well enough that it will not require a rewrite and can just be converved in VS studio.

The vast majority of this project is using https://pokeapi.co/ for the data. Please feel free to donate and/or aid them in anyway for their open resouce of this project.
